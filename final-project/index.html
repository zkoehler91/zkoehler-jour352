      <p>David Cutcliffe had brought Duke its best run of success — six bowls in seven years — before falling back to five wins over his final two seasons. Enter Elko, coming from Texas A&M as defensive coordinator. He brought the program back up, with a 16-9 record in just two seasons, before returning to Texas A&M as head coach. This tenure would probably get a higher grade if it lasted more than two years.</p>

      <p>A championship-winning Group of 5 head coach with an Alabama and Clemson background, Napier looked like a brilliant hire at the time. But it went terribly. Mullen had gone 34-15 in four seasons, with three top-15 finishes, and was fired with a 5-6 record in Year 4. Napier was worse, going 22-23 in four seasons with one winning season. He was also fired in Year 4. The two coaches combined for the first run of three consecutive losing seasons at Florida since 1948.
      This grade is kept from being an F because the Gators at least remained in regular bowl contention, and Napier did improve recruiting late in his tenure. The next coach will have a chance to keep talented players like D.J. Lagway, Jadan Baugh and Dallas Wilson.</p>

      <p>Kelly was hired with a massive 10-year contract and expected to win a national championship. He didn’t get close, and that failure will now cost LSU as much as $53 million, the second-largest buyout ever. His hire was a stunning coup at the time; no sitting head coach had left Notre Dame for another job in more than a century. The previous three LSU head coaches had won national titles, including Ed Orgeron, who was fired less than two years after his title. That was the bar.
      Kelly won games, with a 34-14 record in four seasons and one SEC Championship Game appearance, and produced a Heisman Trophy winner in Jayden Daniels. But he never won the SEC, made the College Football Playoff or finished in the top 10, which are the expectations. It would’ve been considered a perfectly fine run at most jobs but not at LSU, which also tripled its roster spending to $18 million for this year’s team, only to get the same middling results. Kelly fixed the broken defense only to then find a broken offense, and he ran out of time and patience. Kelly’s failure to meet the expectations also brought down his athletic director, Scott Woodward, and sent the school into a tailspin in which the governor of Louisiana got himself involved.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Cristobal has been given more money for staff and players than Miami had ever spent before. The results have included notable improvement but also frustration. After two middling seasons, Miami went 10-2 in 2024 and missed the Playoff. This year’s team reached No. 2 in the polls but took two upset losses once again and now sits on the CFP bubble at 6-2. Cristobal has lost four games as a multi-score betting favorite in the last two years, and his teams’ continued management and discipline problems could cost the Canes another chance at the CFP.
      Last year was just Miami’s second 10-win season since 2003, and this year could still end with double-digit victories. The program is most certainly better under Cristobal. But the case can also be made that it has fallen short of its talent level, including with a future No. 1 pick at quarterback last year. Four years without an ACC Championship Game appearance was not the expectation when he got the job. Cristobal has done better than Miami’s recent history but not as well as expected.</p>

      <p>Kelly left to win a national championship, but it was Freeman who reached last year’s national championship after two top-20 seasons. Freeman is 39-12 since being promoted to the job, and Notre Dame has upgraded the program infrastructure in all kinds of ways. When Kelly left, people wondered whether Notre Dame had a ceiling in the modern game. Freeman showed that’s not the case after all.</p>

      <p>Venables has led Oklahoma to its only two losing seasons of the 2000s, and his teams have failed to score a touchdown against Texas three times in four years. At the same time, he has a 10-win season in 2023, and this year’s group is a top-15 outfit on the CFP bubble.
      He took over a program that was accustomed to conference titles and CFP appearances, even if it was starting to slip under Riley. He had to reorient the Sooners around a rebuild, and the move to the SEC made that tougher. Ten-win seasons won’t be a given like they used to be, but there are too many holes in Year 4, like the offensive line, to call things a success so far. Still, things are trending upward again, and a strong finish this season could get this up in the B-range. A poor finish could put Venables back on the hot seat.</p>

      <p>Lanning was a bit of an unknown when Oregon hired him, but he’s 42-7 and posted an undefeated regular season with a Big Ten title last year. Six of those seven losses are to eventual/current top-10 teams, which is the only knock against his tenure. Oregon is still trying to get over that final hump to a national title, but it has one of the best coaches in the country. Lanning isn’t leaving anytime soon, either, with a very school-friendly buyout of at least $20 million.</p>

That was followed by a 5-7 season, but the Frogs rebounded with nine wins last year and a 6-2 start this year. Dykes’ tenure has been inconsistent, but undoubtedly an improvement.

He showed up at USC, took over a four-win team and immediately won 11 games, only missing the Playoff because of a Pac-12 title game loss. The Trojans dropped to 8-5 and 7-6 over the next two years and are currently 6-2 and in the top 20. Helton made two New Year’s Six games in his first two seasons. Riley has made one. He did bring this program back from the doldrums, but it’s far from the championship level that was expected. Still, things are generally trending upward this year, including a 2026 recruiting class that currently ranks No. 1.</p>

      <p>Akron has had one winning season in the last 20 years, so the bar is low. When Moorhead left the Oregon offensive coordinator job for Akron, it was a surprising step down for someone who could’ve gotten a better job. He took over a program with three total wins over three seasons and has won 11 games over three-plus seasons, so it’s a modest improvement. The program is serving a bowl ban this year due to academics, though making a bowl game seemed unlikely anyway.</p>

      <p>Skip Holtz had reached seven consecutive bowl games but was fired after one 3-9 season. Cumbie comes from the Mike Leach tree and had done well as Texas Tech’s interim head coach in 2021, earning a head coaching shot. But he didn’t win more than five games in any of his first three seasons. This year’s team is 5-3 with a stout defense, so a bowl trip and grade upgrade look possible.</p>

      <p>Wilson was a longtime Nevada assistant who’d done a good job coaching Oregon’s linebackers. It seemed like a natural fit, but he posted consecutive 2-10 seasons and was fired after two years.</p>

      <p>Kill stepped down as Minnesota head coach in 2015 due to health issues but stuck around as an assistant at various places. He got the NMSU job and did what he’s always done: Create a winner. The Aggies had played in one bowl game in the previous 60 years, but Kill (and quarterback Diego Pavia) reached two bowls in two seasons, including 10 wins in 2023, before Kill again stepped down as a head coach due to health concerns. He and Pavia are now at Vanderbilt.</p>

      <p>When Dykes left for TCU, SMU turned to his former offensive coordinator. The Mustangs won the American Conference in 2023, their first conference title in 40 years, and then reached the ACC Championship Game and the CFP last year in their first ACC season. Lashlee inherited a program in good shape and made it better by fixing the defense and the late-season swoons.</p>

      <p>A program that became a Group of 5 winner in the mid-2010s had fallen back, so in came Drayton from Texas, with a pre-existing relationship with Temple’s AD. Drayton inherited a 3-9 team and posted three 3-win seasons himself before getting fired last year.</p>

      <p>A former Troy assistant, Sumrall came in, took over a program that had posted three consecutive five-win seasons and changed it instantly. Sumrall went 23-4 with two Sun Belt championships in two years before leaving for Tulane.</p>

      <p>When Edsall was fired, some wondered what the point of UConn football even was anymore, especially after conference realignment and seven out of eight seasons with three wins or fewer. Hiring Mora, who’d had a moderately successful run at UCLA, was a splash. To everyone’s credit, Mora is 24-23 in four seasons, and UConn is one win away from a third bowl appearance in four years.</p>
